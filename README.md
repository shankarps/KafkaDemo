## KafkaDemo
A project to demo the features of Kafka. This open source project is to practice code the concepts from the documentation of the Spring Kafka library.

The documentation is here - https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.1.6.RELEASE/reference/html/_introduction.html

### Project components
The project uses Java 8, Spring Kafka. I intend to use the Embedded Kafka server, instead of running Kafka separately. This is to make running the programs easier.

### Project Structure
The project is organized as a list of test cases that practice each chapter.
The test cases are organized by chapters. For example the test cases for the Introduction chapter (Chapter 3) are in package "chapter3".
